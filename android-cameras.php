A new class of Android-connected cameras is just beginning to make its appearance (check out the
<a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/onsite/android-camera">Samsung Galaxy Camera</a>, for example). Running the FotoZap<sup>®</sup> app on one of these connected cameras turns it into the ultimate<a href="http://picturemarketing.com">social marketing tool</a>. <!--more-->

Why? In the hands of your brand's front-line staff, FotoZap converts every face-to-face interaction into visual social media - a branded photo or video - that can be shared immediately on any social network.

<h5>Hand your customers something that will spark sharing.</h5>
Hand out a branded photo print that displays a unique key code in the corner of the print. The code allows users to privately access a digital copy of their photo or video, directly through your brand's Facebook Page. The FotoZap system creates a "branded story" worth sharing, amplifies that sharing by giving consumers a reason to post on social networks, and collects data when users log on to see their images.The FotoZap app presents multiple ways to deliver the captured photo or video to a guest. Choose the method that best fits your particular promotion, or choose based on what is most convenient for each guest: hand out a branded print, type in an email address for instant photo delivery, or hand guests a branded card with retrieval instructions (and other messaging, incentives, or special offers).

Or, hand your guest a pre-printed giveaway card containing a private key to their online photo. Giveaway cards make it easy for a brand to activate anywhere and at any scale.

Simply scan a card with the FotoZap app to activate it, or type in the guest's email address.

The link on the printed photo, branded giveaway card, or photo delivery email leads directly to your brand’s Facebook Page, where the consumer can view their branded image, share it, and take advantage of your coupon downloads, online promotions, or special offers. This is the perfect way to create true fans of your brand -- fans that actually engage with your content.
