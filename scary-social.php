The FotoZap<sup>®</sup> app lets your staff control
how the consumer's photo will be transformed</td>


<p >Your staff act as brand ambassadors as they take photos of guests with the FotoZap app. By selecting a campaign in the app, they determine how the photo will be altered and with which of your branded messages it will appear. Photos can be viewed on a fully branded <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/microsites/microsites-for-any-use">microsite</a>, <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/social/direct-to-facebook">directly on Facebook</a>, or <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/social/sms-pc-mobile-access">on any mobile phone</a>.</p>
<p >To give the photo as a gift, a staff member can: type in a guest's email address, hand out a keepsake <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/onsite/giveaway-cards">Giveaway Card</a> or do both to supercharge engagement. Other app options include the ability to capture a <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/mobile/photo-video-capture">photo or video</a>, capture <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/mobile/in-app-online-survey">survey</a> responses, and import photos or videos from a <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/microsites/use-with-3rd-party">3rd party app</a> like Instagram or iMovie. The FotoZap® app is available on <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/onsite/android-devices">Android</a>, <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/onsite/iphone">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/onsite/ipad">iPad</a>, and built into the proprietary <a href="http://picturemarketing.com/#/products/onsite/fotozap-cameras">FotoZap Camera</a>.</p>
